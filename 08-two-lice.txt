8. Two Lice
Leaving the clinic, I felt a wave of relief. The doctor said I wasn’t sick, so I guess I’m fine, right? With a few hours before quitting time, I finally had some time to myself. I found a small diner for lunch, then headed to a bathhouse to soak and relax.
Soaking in the bath was pure bliss. I used to come every weekend, but since having a kid, I’ve had no time for it.
After the bath, I settled in the lounge, ordered a beer, and watched a game on the big screen. It was a weekday, so the lounge was nearly empty. In the corner, I overheard some scantily clad girls whispering: “Look, a handsome guy. Go for it.” One of them got up and walked toward me.
She plopped down next to my leg. “Hey, handsome, here alone?”
I could only respond, “Yeah, alone, but I’m just here to bathe. I’ll finish my beer and leave. Not looking to spend more.”
Maybe my tone wasn’t firm enough, and she mistook it for playing hard to get. She didn’t budge, scooting even closer. “Doesn’t matter if you spend or not. I just saw you alone and thought I’d chat.”
I tried again. “I’m not much for chatting. You staying here might hold up your real business.”
“Hehehe!” She burst into laughter. “What real business? Look at this empty lounge. I just want someone to talk to.”
I was confused. In her line of work, just wanting to chat without profit? I started studying her. She was young, with a small face, small eyes, nose, and mouth—except for her oversized black pupils, probably from colored contacts. Her eyebrows were hidden under straight purple bangs. Her purple hair draped over her pale, almost paper-like face, looking oddly mismatched.
I was still thinking of an excuse to get her to leave when she spoke again. “Let me tell you a joke. A woman had two lice living in her hair. One day, she used hair dye, and the chemicals were so strong they poisoned one louse. The other got scared and moved out, traveling far until it found a dark forest like its old home. It thought it’d settle there, but that night, it fled back in terror—because it saw a one-eyed snake! Hahaha!”
She was cracking herself up, but I couldn’t laugh. To humans, a louse’s struggle is just a joke. But if you’re the louse, it’s not funny—it’s terrifying.
She kept laughing. “Don’t you think it’s funny?”
Her joke made me uneasy, her laughter even more grating. I waved her off. “Alright, you’re done. Just go.”
My words clearly offended her. Her smile froze, her face turning icy. “I wasn’t finished. Want to know what happened to the other louse?”
I cut her off. “I’m not interested. Get away from me!”
She didn’t seem to hear, her eyes boring into me, her voice dripping with venom. “The woman wouldn’t let that louse go. It deserved to die!”
She leaned closer, then lifted her purple bangs. On her forehead were countless red scars—fresh, scabbed-over blood marks crisscrossing into four distorted Chinese characters: In Memory of Wei Wu.
I recognized the handwriting—it was mine. Why was it on her forehead? She leaned even closer, her purple hair and oversized eyes making her face look more and more like the cave’s human face.
Terrified, I jerked back, tumbling off the couch. She jumped down, pinning me to the floor. “Don’t rush off. Let me show you a trick.”
I wanted to run, but her weight held me down. Her small mouth stretched impossibly wide, reaching her ears, revealing two rows of sharp teeth. Behind them, her vocal cords began vibrating violently.
“Ring-ring-ring!” With the vibrations came that piercing bell.
I woke up at my office desk. The phone beside me wouldn’t stop ringing. I picked it up, and there it was again—that raspy, genderless voice: “That box must not be opened!”
Seconds later, a message popped up in the work group chat:
Financial Department Manager Sun: Meeting today at 4:45 regarding recent work arrangements (2022-10-10)
I was back in the afternoon of October 10 again.
