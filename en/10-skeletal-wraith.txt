10. Skeletal Wraith
Leaving the psychology clinic, I didn’t go to the bathhouse. I grabbed five buns from a roadside stall and headed home. In the bedroom, I collapsed onto the bed, devoid of motivation for anything.
“Why’d you stop it for him? Why’d you let him go?” The old, raspy voice from Dr. Xu’s clinic echoed in my mind. The more I thought about it, the more it felt like he was talking about me, and the more uneasy I became. It was as if danger was lurking right in front of me, ready to strike, but I was blind to it.
If that old voice was indeed referring to me, what connection did he have to me? Why had Dr. Xu hypnotized me? What were they plotting behind my back?
I racked my brains but found no answers. Exhausted, I lay on the bed, needing some proper rest. The moment I closed my eyes, a low sobbing sound suddenly came from behind the bedroom wall. Was it the man next door crying? Our apartment had excellent soundproofing, but in the quiet afternoon, the weeping pierced my brain like needles, making me nauseous.
In the end, driven by extreme mental fatigue, I drifted into sleep amid the irritating sobs.
I was jolted awake by a creaking door. The crying instantly amplified with the sound. It wasn’t just one person—it was a chorus of men and women wailing together. Annoyed, I opened my eyes and looked toward the source of the noise: the front door of our apartment was open. In the dim living room, a black silhouette limped toward my bedroom, carrying a box.
I bolted upright in bed. Who was he? How did he get into my house?
As he approached the bedroom, sunlight from the window illuminated his face. It was terrifying—a skeletal wraith, so emaciated he was practically a ghost draped in flesh.
He kept limping forward, each step causing the box in his hand to bump his stiff leg, producing that “creak-creak” sound. I noticed the box—old, made of wooden planks nailed together. The green paint was half-peeled, exposing the wood’s natural brown. But on the remaining paint, I could clearly see a pattern: vines with heart-shaped leaves. This was the third time I’d seen that pattern on a box. Every time it appeared, something bad happened. I’d developed an instinctive fear of it.
The “creak-creak” stopped. The skeletal wraith froze at the bedroom doorway, staring at me, his face expressionless.
I wanted to ask who he was, but my face went numb, my mouth refusing to move.
“You have three days left to live,” he said suddenly. That voice—the same old, raspy voice from Dr. Xu’s clinic! It was him!
The “creak-creak” resumed as he turned and limped out.
“…You…” I struggled to control my numb face, forcing a sound from my throat.
He heard me, pausing to turn back, still expressionless. “You can end it sooner if you want.”
With that, he limped away, disappearing into the dim living room.
I sat rigid in bed. Why was I scared? I snapped to my senses. I’m a man in my thirties, in my prime. That scrawny, limping old man dared to break into my house in broad daylight and threaten me with three days to live? Rage surged, dissolving the numbness in my face. I leapt from the bed and charged into the living room.
The moment I jumped down, I knew my plan: grab his collar, lift him off the ground, and demand answers.
But the living room felt wrong—unnaturally dim for daytime. I fumbled toward the wall to flip on the light. As I reached it, a gust of wind roared, carrying sand that stung my eyes. I shut them in pain, crouching and clinging to the wall to steady myself. One hand on the wall, the other on the ground, I kept low. Then I realized—the floor wasn’t my smooth living room tiles. It was rough sand.
I rubbed my eyes and forced them open. The dimness persisted, but I saw the wall I was holding: not my white wall, but a gray slab etched with red characters: …Deceased…Xu…Ancestor…
Those words sent me reeling back. How had my wall become a tombstone?
I stumbled into another tombstone, then realized I was surrounded by them. As the light slowly brightened, my vision cleared. This wasn’t my living room—it was a graveyard! I stood in the center, dozens of tombstones scattered haphazardly around me. A few meters ahead, at the graveyard’s edge, stood a dilapidated wooden house.
Where was I?
I walked toward the house, hoping someone inside could explain. Up close, it was even more decrepit. The wooden walls, studded with rusty nails, had gaps between loose planks. The front door, red and weathered, had no lock, its hinges broken, the panel leaning crookedly against the frame.
I knocked lightly. No response. I knocked harder.
Crash! A sound of shattering glass came from inside.
“Anyone there?” I called from outside.
Silence. Someone was inside but wouldn’t answer. Curiosity drove me to push the door.
I eased it open halfway. The interior was pitch black, and an unnatural, icy wind blew out. Should I go in? As I leaned forward, a hand gripped my wrist.
“Honey! Honey!”
It was Ruoli’s voice, calling my name. Everything went dark, then brightened. The wooden house and graveyard vanished. I was standing on my apartment’s balcony, the window half-open, cold wind howling outside. My upper body was leaning out. Ruoli gripped my wrist, staring at me in panic. “You… you were going to jump?”
I glanced down from our 13th-floor balcony. The height sent a shudder through me. I yanked myself back, collapsing onto the balcony floor, the wraith’s words echoing: “You have three days left to live. You can end it sooner if you want.”
