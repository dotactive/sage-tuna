15. Blood Soup

The clock on the screen ticked away, second by second. For the first time, I felt utter helplessness—my remaining life was now measured in hours.

I closed my eyes, buried my hands in my hair, and slumped over the desk. At that moment, I sensed something moving in the drawer beneath me. The half-bottle of water, separated by the thin panel, sloshed with an urgent rhythm. It was urging me: Decide now.

Harm someone else, or wait for my own death? I didn’t know. If this was truly my final time, how should I spend these less than forty-eight hours? Definitely not reconciling expense reports in this office—I needed to be with my family.

*Smack!* A sudden slap on the desk made me snap my eyes open and sit bolt upright. Manager Sun was standing at my desk, glaring.

“Sleeping on the job now? I’ll say it again: two days. Don’t finish—don’t come home!”

All the pent-up frustration inside me suddenly found an outlet. I gritted my teeth. So what if I became the evil spirit’s servant? Being corporate livestock for anyone was the same, wasn’t it? I yanked open the drawer. The bottle slowly rolled out from the depths. But the instant it saw daylight, I slammed the drawer shut with force. Others treated me like livestock—I couldn’t treat myself the same.

The bang startled Manager Sun. “What’s with the attitude? I said don’t finish, don’t come home. What, slamming drawers at me now?”

Don’t finish, don’t come home? Screw that—I’m going home now!

I ignored the manager, the job, the receipts. I stood and strode out of the office under everyone’s stunned gazes.

I’d pick up Xiaobao from kindergarten, buy him his favorite toy, get Ruoli her favorite milk tea, then cook their favorite dinner.

Back in the bustling downtown, the same outdoor speaker blared on loop: “Last two days. Last two days…” I hurried forward. Just as I neared the edge of the chaos, a commotion erupted behind me, followed by screams.

I turned. A man was chasing a crowd. Among the fleeing were passersby, restaurant staff, stall owners—all faces etched with terror. I recognized the pursuer: the young migrant worker from the bun stall at lunch. He brandished a knife, chasing the crowd, his body already splattered with blood. He’d really attacked innocents.

The runners fled for their lives. At the rear was a pregnant woman with a backpack, dragging her heavy belly, stumbling toward me. Suddenly, she slipped and fell. Ignoring the pain, she struggled to get up. But her movements were clumsy, compounded by panic and fear—she tried and failed several times.

I couldn’t stand by. I rushed to help her. But I was too late. When I was a meter away, the knife-wielding killer stood over her. Without hesitation, he raised the blade and stabbed down. The woman blocked with her backpack. It was useless—several slashes tore it open, revealing a thermos inside. By the time I reached them, the thermos shattered, hot soup splashing all over me. The first time in my life I’d been doused in soup—soup mixed with human blood.

The woman’s artery was severed; blood sprayed out, mingling with the hot soup from the thermos, soaking me. I froze, stunned by the bloody scene, rooted in place. Before I could react, the killer stood before me. He raised the bloodied knife again and thrust it toward my neck. I saw my own blood arc several meters, then my vision blurred, light fading, sounds silencing. Until everything went black and dead quiet. But my sense of smell remained—I could still detect the soup’s aroma on me, fragrant with black chicken and eyebrows beans. So the last thing in my life was savoring chicken soup.

…

Tap-tap-tap… In the silence, keyboard clacks suddenly sounded. The soup’s fragrance vanished; my vision gradually brightened. A figure appeared before me, seemingly speaking. I couldn’t hear. Suddenly, a hand slammed down: Smack!

The noise sharpened my sight. It was Manager Sun from Finance, pounding the desk and yelling: “I’ll say it again: two days! Don’t finish—don’t come home!”

I was back in the office. The wall clock read 2:10 p.m.

I wasn’t dead? Another dream? But the chicken soup that splashed me felt too real—I could still recall the taste.

As I puzzled over whether it was a dream, the computer answered: the clock in the bottom-right corner read 46:53:05.

From the start of this countdown, leaving the office, to the stabbing in the downtown—about an hour. I’d returned to 2:10 p.m., but the countdown hadn’t reset. Was this the real time?

I had even less time. Ignoring Manager Sun, I rushed out of the office again under shocked stares, back to the bustling downtown. The chaos continued; no one sensed danger. In the crowd, one man stood motionless by the roadside, right hand in a black plastic bag, left pressing it down. No one noticed him but me—I knew what the bag hid: a knife. A knife soon to be drenched in blood.
