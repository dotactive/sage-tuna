13. Wolf-Pack Company

“You were born to be corporate livestock. You have only the right to obey—no choice.”

That voice was like a rusty iron hook, digging into the back of my neck. I clutched the half-bottle of water and fled the underpass as if running for my life.

The sunlight was blinding, the streets deafening, yet I could barely tell which was the real dream. The desert cave? The graveyard hut? Or this office tower packed with livestock? Inside, shadows of busy figures darted back and forth—beasts of burden rolling inward just to keep their feed. At that moment, I even wondered which was more terrifying: the two-day curse or the threat of a broken mortgage?

The elevator doors closed with a “ding.” In the mirrored wall, my haggard face stared back, the half-bottle in my hand swaying left and right at a steady rhythm—like a beating heart.

I pushed open the office door. Colleagues immediately swarmed around me, oozing concern:

“Tuna, you okay?”
“Feeling better now?”
“If you’re not well, rest more—your wife and kid are counting on you.”
…

“Come to my office.” A cold voice sliced through the warm fuss. Manager Sun appeared behind me, utterly out of tune. The moment they heard her, my colleagues scattered like cockroaches in the underpass, instantly back at their desks.

I followed her into the office and casually set the half-bottle on her desk. Her gaze snapped to it, locking in place.

That hollow stare sent chills down my spine. I coughed lightly. She jolted awake, shifted her eyes to me, and snapped, “Why weren’t you at work yesterday?”

“I… my headache was killing me when I woke up…”

“Just a little headache and you skip work?” She’d twisted my “killing me” into “a little.” I didn’t interrupt—of course—and let her keep spraying. “Year-end is crazy busy, and you pick now to take sick leave? One day gone—who’s doing your work?”

“definetly not you.” I thought.

She went on, full of righteous fury: “We’re a wolf-pack company. Our employees are wolf-pack employees! I came in with a 39-degree fever and still worked!”

Wolf-pack company? Just wolves that devour people without spitting out the bones, squeezing every last drop of oil from us. As management, all she did was squeeze us to do her job while she slacked off all day. A 39-degree fever just meant slacking while sick. The whole department knows what’s up—she’s the only one over there self-moved to tears.

She ranted on, face red, spit flying. I’d long stopped listening. I started wondering why she was such a psycho, and then it clicked—I even felt sorry for her.

She barked at underlings because she got barked at worse by the big boss. The big boss, Yin—sixty-something ex-soldier, explosive temper—cursed all day, sometimes even hit people. We call him Emperor Yin. His only perk? He’s blissfully clueless that “Yin-di” sounds just like “clit” in Chinese. Keeps us from getting fired for giggling.

Emperor Yin dropped by Finance every few days, screamed at her until the whole building heard, and a few times made her cry. She was just another link in this so-called wolf-pack food chain. In this chain, everyone above is your master, everyone below is your dog—and every master gets his turn as the bitch, Even Emperor Yin.

He was pitiful too. At work he strutted and swore; at home he knelt to his wife and father-in-law. The old man was a high-ranking officer; the company’s contracts all came through connections. Yin had married in, daughter took her mother’s surname. No status at home. Men bottle it up, then unload at the office. Negative energy passed down the chain—everyone a victim.

Just as I pitied Emperor Yin, Manager Sun suddenly shut up. The office, loud with curses a second ago, went dead silent—like someone hit mute. All I heard was my own heartbeat and a dry gulp from her throat.

Her eyes locked on the half-bottle. She slowly raised a hand, hovering in mid-air, then her whole body leaned toward it. The instant her fingers touched the bottle, she seized it, arm bending stiffly, ready to pour the water into her mouth. Every move was unnatural—like a marionette on invisible strings.

I lunged forward, snatched it back, and blurted, “Tap water—for my plants.”

She froze for half a second, tongue lingering at the corner of her lip as if tasting something that wasn’t there. She blinked; a flash of purple-black crossed her pupils, then her face went blank. “Oh. Wrong bottle.”

She stood there, forgetting her next line.

Three seconds of dead air.  
She jerked, eyes lighting up belatedly—like waking from a dream.

“Ah—right—”

She yanked open a drawer in a panic, papers scattering, and slammed a thick stack of receipts on the desk. “Get all these reconciled and entered. You have two days. Don’t finish—don’t come home.”

“Two days?”

Still rattled by that cursed bottle, the words “two days” hit me like a thorn yanked deeper. Yesterday the skin-clad skeleton gave me three. Was the curse really closing in?
