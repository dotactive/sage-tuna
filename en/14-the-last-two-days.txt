14. The Last Two Days

I carried a thick stack of expense receipts back to my desk. The first thing I did was lock that eerie half-bottle of water in the drawer. Was I really going to make someone else drink it? If I didn’t, would I die in two days? And the final moments of my life would be spent here, reconciling these damn receipts. I shook my head helplessly, picked up the first slip, and got to work—there was no choice.

All morning, I repeated the same mind-numbing tasks, forcing myself not to think about those intangible horrors. Until I overheard two female colleagues chatting behind me: “I’m going on vacation the day after tomorrow. Just two more days, and you won’t see me!” “Haha, any last words then?”

My barely relaxed nerves snapped tight again. I glanced at the clock—it was lunch break. I bolted out of the suffocating office building. Wondering what to eat, my phone buzzed in my pocket. I pulled it out—another spam text. Spam was annoying enough, but this one was vile: **“Sports Update: XX vs. XX, the final two days of a life-or-death battle.”** I blocked the sender, deleted the message, and shut off the phone. The text killed my appetite entirely. I wandered the streets aimlessly.

“Zzz—” A grating noise suddenly blared beside me. I turned to see a shop blasting music from an outdoor speaker. After a burst of static, it roared at ear-splitting volume: “Last two days. Last two days. Clearance sale. Everything half price. Last two days. Last two days…”

The sound drilled into my skull. I clapped my hands over my ears and fled as fast as I could. The speaker kept looping, reminding me: two days left.

After ten minutes, I escaped the noisy downtown and reached a construction site area. No restaurants here—just a steamed bun stall, mostly serving nearby migrant workers. I had no appetite for anything else, so I ordered five buns and sat down to eat.

“Ding-ding-ding, ding-ding-ding.”

Moments after sitting, a bell rang behind me. I turned—a black curly-haired dog with a bell around its neck. Covered in dust, it was missing a front leg, limping with every step, the bell jingling nonstop.

The stall owner saw the dog, grabbed a bun from the steamer, and tossed it over. The dog didn’t flinch at the heat and buried its head in the food.

“Boss, feeding meat buns to a dog?” a young worker teased, watching the owner.

The owner sighed. “Some abandoned stray. It’s been hanging around here lately. The city management called today, asking if there’s a stray dog in the area. They’ll probably come catch it in the next two days. Once they do, it’s done for. Sigh… I can’t do much. Just let it eat its fill these last two days. Better to go with a full stomach.”

Hearing this, my throat tightened. The bun in my mouth wouldn’t go down.

The young worker spoke again: “Poor thing. Look at those drooping eyelids—it knows it doesn’t have long.”

“You should worry about yourself first,” an older worker said. “We haven’t worked in days. Word is the contractor skipped town. This project’s dead. If we don’t get our wages, how do you survive? Check your pockets—how much you got left? Between you and that dog, who goes first is anyone’s guess.”

“Fuck! They dare hold my wages?” the young worker exploded. “My dad keeps calling for money—my mom’s hospital bills are due. She’ll die the second she’s discharged. They’d even steal lifesaving money?”

The older worker shook his head. “Think of another way. If the contractor’s gone, no one’s getting paid. He doesn’t care if it’s lifesaving.”

The young man grew angrier: “If he won’t pay, I’ll take him down with me. He won’t let me live—he doesn’t get to either.”

The older worker shook his head again. “If he’s skipped town, where you gonna find him?”

The young man clenched his teeth, hissing through them: “Then I’ll stab a few random people on the street. I’m done with this dog’s life anyway. One kill breaks even, two and I profit.”

His voice was low, but it sent a chill down my spine. I glanced at him out of the corner of my eye. Minutes ago, he’d been all sympathy for the dog. Now his eyes were bloodshot, demonic.

I shoved the last bite of bun in my mouth and fled back to the office like my life depended on it.

Back at my desk, I sat for a long time before turning on the computer and resuming the tedious work, entering receipts one by one. When I looked up at the screen, something abnormal appeared, making my hair stand on end.

The screen was the same, Windows running normally. But in the bottom-right corner, where the clock should be, it read: **48:00:00**.

Before now all those “last two days” could be brushed off as coincidence. This clock on the computer? No explanation.

My mind went blank. I stared at **48:00:00**. I don’t know how long—until the numbers suddenly moved: **47:59:59**.

My heart jolted. **47:59:58, 47:59:57…** The countdown had begun. I glanced at the wall clock—around 2:10 p.m., exactly the time yesterday when the skeletal wraith had appeared at my home to pronounce my death sentence.
