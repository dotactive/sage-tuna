16. The Evil Spirit

Faced with a man intent on murder, how was I supposed to stop him? I had no experience, so I tried starting with what he needed.

I stopped five meters away and tested the waters.  
“Buddy, are you in some kind of trouble?”

His head snapped up, eyes wary. The hand pressing the black plastic bag clenched tighter—he was ready to draw the knife.

I took a step back. “F-friend, no hostility. You look like you’re in a bind. If it’s money, I have some savings—I can lend you some for now.”

He could swing at any second, so I cut to the chase.

“My mom’s dead. What good is money now?” he snarled through gritted teeth. “Because I couldn’t pay her hospital bills. My dad will never forgive me. My sister won’t. My relatives won’t. The whole village will spit on me. All because of you city people! You live in the houses we built with blood and sweat, yet you withhold our wages. Why do you get to live easy while we slave from dawn to dusk and only get poorer?”

His voice rose into a roar. The scornful glances from passers-by became the final straw. He snapped—yanked the knife from the bag, grabbed the nearest bystander, and plunged it in.

“Don’t! You’re still young—”  
My words weren’t finished. I became the second victim. The blade was fast. Pain exploded in my throat, breathing failed, screams faded, and darkness swallowed me once more.

When light returned, Manager Sun stood over me:  
“Two days left! Don’t finish—don’t come home!”

Back in the office. The computer read: **45:40:37**. Even less time.

I instinctively touched my neck; the pain still lingered.

“That animal!” I spat.

“You—you’re cursing me?” Manager Sun’s face twisted.

I wasn’t cursing her (though I might as well have been). I had no time to explain. I stood, yanked open the drawer, grabbed the half-bottle, and headed out.

“Are you leaving?” she shouted.

I turned. She stared, confused and furious. I walked back, reached into her pocket, and took her car keys.

She was too stunned by my bizarre behavior to react until I reached the door. “What are you doing with my keys? Get back here!”

I ignored her, ran to the parking lot, took her SUV, and floored it to the familiar downtown.

Perfect timing—the animal had just drawn his knife. I slammed the accelerator. The car plowed straight into him. He flew several meters, smashed into a wall, bounced, and hit the ground. I couldn’t brake in time and crashed into a utility pole. The speed wasn’t lethal; the airbags didn’t deploy, but the impact left me seeing stars, ears ringing. When I climbed out, the front of the car was caved in—undrivable. Onlookers kept their distance.

The killer lay a few meters away, knife gone, both legs twisted at impossible angles. He couldn’t stand.

He saw me and terror filled his eyes. He dragged himself backward, screaming, “Don’t come near me! Stay away!”

What was he afraid of? I wasn’t armed—only the half-bottle in my hand.

I walked over and held it out.

The moment he saw the water, his struggling stopped. A flash of purple-black crossed his eyes; they went hollow. Slowly, he reached out and seized the bottle. He stared at the liquid for a few seconds… then his face contorted in horror again, as if he’d realized his fate. One hand, moving against his will, forced the bottle to his lips. With his last strength, he screamed at me:

“Filthy beggar—you’ll die a miserable death!”

Filthy beggar? In his eyes, was I the beggar?

Before I could process it, the bottle was jammed into his mouth and emptied.

Cockroaches skittered past my feet. His pupils had turned completely purple-black.

I felt no guilt. It wasn’t this half-bottle that made him an evil spirit—he already was, worse than any spirit.

“I did what you asked. Can I go back to my normal life now?”

The thing possessing him nodded and spoke in that androgynous voice:  
“My business is done. Now go settle your own affairs.”

My own affairs? As I stood confused, a familiar ringtone played—my phone. But I’d turned it off after the spam message.

“Go settle your own affairs,” it repeated, pulling out its phone. It answered and hit speaker.

A shrill woman’s voice exploded: “Think you can hide? Get back here now!”

It was Manager Sun. Impossible.

“You think you can run before the job’s done? I’m telling you—two days left! Don’t finish—don’t come home!”

On the last sentence, the voice was no longer coming from the phone—it was right in front of me. The scene shifted instantly. I was seated in the office, facing Manager Sun’s twisted face. The wall clock was frozen at 2:10.

I was back again. I yanked open the desk drawer in a panic. The half-bottle of water was gone.I looked up at the bottom-right corner of the screen. The countdown was still racing, mercilessly.  

**44:36:22**

Another hour, vanished.
