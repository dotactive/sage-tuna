1. Pandora's Box
I awoke from unconsciousness to find myself sitting in the driver's seat. The car had stalled, and outside the window it was so dark I couldn't see anything. Looking up, through the sunroof I could see a small patch of sky about the size of a palm—I was in a deep pit.

I tried hard to remember what had happened. My colleague Wu Wei and I had teamed up to participate in a livestreamed treasure hunt game. We broadcast our search for clues and after collecting a pile of hints, we calculated the coordinates of the treasure, which was somewhere in a desert. We drove to the coordinates, but all around us was nothing but endless yellow sand. Just as we were feeling disappointed, the car suddenly began to sink, and we plunged, car and all, into a deep hole beneath the rolling sand.

"What the hell? Where are we?"

Wu Wei, who had been knocked unconscious beside me, was now awake.

"Looks like we fell into a pit. Are you hurt?"

He stretched his arms and turned his neck before saying, "Upper body's fine, just my butt hurts."

As he spoke, he pushed open the car door, intending to get out and stretch his legs. But the moment the door opened, a sudden noise erupted from outside: "Tap-tap-tap-tap-tap..."

The sound was loud and dense, like the footsteps of something. I quickly followed Wu Wei out of the car to investigate. When we shined our flashlights around, the sight before us made me nauseous: the walls and floor of the giant pit were crawling with cockroaches.

I had never seen cockroaches this big before—each one was the size of a palm. Some were black, some brown, their bodies gleaming in the flashlight beam.

"Damn! So many cockroaches."

As Wu Wei spoke, he lifted his foot and stepped on a cockroach that was running past him. Then he ground down hard, making a squishing sound as the cockroach was crushed into a black and white pulp.

I didn't want to stay in this hellish place for even a minute. I quickly took out my phone to try to call for help, but there was no signal at all—not even for emergency calls.

Wu Wei seemed quite calm. He didn't appear anxious to leave and instead shined his flashlight around, examining this "cockroach pit." While I climbed onto the car roof searching for a signal, Wu Wei suddenly called out from the darkness: "Come quick, look at this!"

I followed his voice and saw him kneeling in front of a raised stone platform, examining a square copper box on top of it. I call it a copper box because it was covered in green oxidation. The box was exquisitely crafted, with each side engraved with plant-like patterns—curved stems with heart-shaped leaves. On the top lid was an oval pattern, though it had become quite blurry with age. At first glance, the oval pattern looked like a cockroach without legs.

"Could this be the treasure the game wanted us to find?" As Wu Wei spoke, he reached out to pick up the copper box. The box wasn't large—small enough to hold in one hand—but no matter how hard Wu Wei tried, he couldn't lift it, as if the bottom was embedded in the stone platform. He then tried to open the lid, but it was rusted shut.

Something felt off to me. Was this box really a prop from the treasure hunt game? This age-old box clearly wasn't placed here recently. Plus, the game organizers profited from our livestream during the treasure hunt, yet this hiding spot had no phone signal.

By now, Wu Wei had taken out a Swiss Army knife and was trying to pry open the lid. Just as I was about to share my concerns with him, the lid popped open. Full of anticipation, we looked inside the box, only to find it empty.

"Ah!" Wu Wei sighed in frustration. "All that for nothing. Not a single thing. If I had known this would—" He stopped mid-sentence. Because we felt the entire pit begin to shake, trembling more and more violently with a thunderous rumbling. At the same time, the cockroaches on the walls and ground suddenly sprang into action. All of them ran in the same direction, creating a sound like "thousands of galloping horses," almost drowning out the rumbling of the pit. Finally, all the cockroaches poured into a dark hole.

As we stood there in shock, sand suddenly began raining down on us. The falling sand hit our heads painfully. We covered our heads and tried to return to the car, but the sand rain was even more intense around the vehicle, nearly knocking us down. With no choice, we turned back toward the copper box. By now the sand on the ground was already knee-deep, and soon we would be unable to move, yet the sand rain showed no sign of stopping. I felt the despair of being buried alive. I tried to stay calm, searching for any chance of survival amidst the desperation.

"That black hole! Wu Wei! Quick, go to that hole!"

That dark hole the cockroaches had just poured into was our only hope for survival. Wu Wei grabbed my hand and we plunged into the black hole teeming with cockroaches...

And then I woke up. In my own bed at home. The window showed nothing but darkness in the middle of the night. My wife, Ruoli, was sleeping soundly beside me. In the next room, our three-year-old son, Bao, was snoring softly. I am Sage Tuna, the creator of "Desert Treasure Hunt."
