11. The Debt

I slumped onto the balcony floor, Ruoli’s panicked cry still ringing in my ears: “You… were you trying to jump?” The sunlight was blinding, yet it couldn’t dispel the chill in my heart. The words “You have three days left to live” were carved into my mind like a knife. I rubbed my face, trying to shake off the lingering fear, but my stomach churned with a heavy, stone-like pain.

Ruoli sat beside me, seemingly more terrified than I was. She knew me—she knew I’d never abandon her and our child. It took her a long time to calm down before she spoke in a trembling voice: “Have you… been experiencing some strange things lately too?”

That word “too” yanked my barely settled heart back into my throat. “You have too?! What happened to you?”

Ruoli’s voice shook even more. “I had a dream last night. I was alone in the desert, dying of thirst. Then a beggar came, holding half a bottle of water, and handed it to me. I drank it all. Suddenly, he started laughing and said, ‘You owe me half a bottle of water. This debt will be repaid with the lives of your entire family.’”

She paused, fighting to control her quivering lips, then drew a deep breath and continued in a voice I could barely hear: “Just now, when I picked up Xiaobao from school, right downstairs, a sand-covered pickup truck came out of nowhere and charged at us. I scooped Xiaobao up and dodged just in time. The truck brushed past us and stopped ahead. The driver leaned out the window—it was the beggar from my dream, shaking a bottle with half its water at me. And then…”

Her body shuddered again. Her gaze drifted toward Xiaobao’s room, her voice dropping lower: “The worst part… Xiaobao said he dreamed of that beggar uncle last night too, holding a green box.” My heart froze, blood turning to ice. Xiaobao? Our child was tangled up in this too?

I shot to my feet and rushed into Xiaobao’s room. Pushing the door open, I found him curled up, kneeling on the floor, arms wrapped around his chest, head buried deep in that green paper box, motionless, as if something had sucked him in. The eerie posture sent a cold sweat down my spine. I ran over and pulled him up: “Xiaobao! Are you okay? Why are you inside the box?” He slowly lifted his head, eyes vacant, staring at the box. Instead of answering, he said, “Give me some water.”

That wasn’t Xiaobao’s voice. When he was thirsty, he’d only say, “I’m thirsty.”

A chill ran through me, as if I’d fallen into an ice pit. This thing wasn’t just after me—it had Ruoli and Xiaobao too. It was real. Everything that had happened these past few days was real. I couldn’t run from it anymore. I had to face it, resolve it. I had to protect my family.

I turned and headed for the front door. I was going to the underpass to find the beggar with Wu Wei’s face and get answers. As I twisted the lock, Ruoli suddenly hugged me from behind: “Where are you going?”

Her voice was tense, her grip so tight I could barely move. I comforted her: “Don’t be afraid. You and Xiaobao will be fine. I know where that beggar is. I’m going to him.”

She clung even tighter: “Don’t leave us. I’m scared at home.”

She was right—she’d just been through something terrifying. I couldn’t leave her alone now. I turned, gently wrapping my arms around her trembling body: “Okay. I won’t go tonight. I’m staying. No one will touch you.” Only when she heard I wasn’t leaving did she collapse into my arms, relieved.

That evening, Ruoli went through her routine—bathing Xiaobao, doing laundry, reading to him. Every time I tried to discuss these bizarre encounters and how to deal with them, she deliberately changed the subject. She was too frightened to face it.

Night fell again, as it always did. I lay in bed, my body unable to relax. My limbs were heavy, every movement a struggle. In this state of utter exhaustion, I slipped into tonight’s dream.

Tonight’s dream was strange, unlike the others. There was no continuation of previous events—no plot at all, just abrupt shifts between scenes:

It started in the office, where I was alone, staring motionless at a black computer screen. Then the scene switched to Dr. Xu’s clinic. Dr. Xu was gone; I was alone, fixated on the dripping device, counting the drops—one, two, three… three hundred five, three hundred six… until a face suddenly appeared before me: the old man, the “skin-clad skeleton.” Then I was in the graveyard, surrounded by haphazard tombstones and that dilapidated house. Suddenly, I stood at the house’s door, the broken wooden panel leaning crookedly against the frame. The door slowly opened. I stepped inside. A figure sat there with Wu Wei’s face. I jolted awake in terror, sitting bolt upright in bed.

Daylight poured in, harsh and bright. The wall clock read 9:00 a.m. I’d slept in. Ruoli and Xiaobao were already gone; I was alone.

I recalled the sinister dream. Wu Wei again. What did he have to do with my family’s ordeal? I couldn’t wait another second. I threw on clothes, grabbed a half-finished bottle of water from the dining table, and headed straight for the underpass.

The beggar was still there, kneeling, his tattered clothes reeking of mold. I took a deep breath, walked up, and stood before him.

He didn’t look up, just extended a hand and rasped, “Give me some water.”

I handed him the bottle I’d prepared. He took it, slowly raising his head. Beneath the matted hair were Wu Wei’s eyes. “What do you want?”

I stared into those eyes and asked coldly, “Who are you?”

His voice boomed: “I am Wu Wei!”

He was Wu Wei? A character I’d made up for a story, now real? I pressed him: “How can you be Wu Wei? How is Wu Wei alive?”

He replied, “I’m not alive. I died five years ago.”

I staggered back. How could a dead man sit here talking to me? But I had a more pressing question: “How did you die?”

His voice grew louder: “You killed me.”
