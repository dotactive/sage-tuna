12. The Last Half-Bottle of Water
In the dim underpass, Wu Wei, reeking of mold, recounted the events from five years ago. My memories were slowly reawakening.
Back then, Wu Wei and I ran a self-media channel on a video website, posting clips of our adventures in no-man’s-land. During one desert-crossing challenge, we fell into a cave in the sands. We wandered inside for days. In the end, I was the only one who made it out alive, while Wu Wei was left forever in that cave. Because I had drunk the last half-bottle of water—our only one.
His voice grew louder as he spoke, laced with resentment: “I trusted you as my closest teammate. With my dying breath, I managed to say, ‘Give me some water.’ And you handed me a bottle… filled with nothing but sand.”
“Sand?” Why would I have given him a bottle of sand when he asked for water? I strained to remember: “No! I’m sure there was water in it.”
“No! Don’t!” Just as confusion gripped me, Wu Wei across from me suddenly cried out in terror, his eyes fixed on the half-bottle of water in his hand. An utterly ordinary bottle. What was he afraid of?
Trembling, he raised the bottle to his face, as if his hand were no longer his own. His eyes widened in greater horror, and he kept muttering, “No, no…” He tried to say more, but the bottle’s mouth was already forced between his lips. A series of gulping sounds followed as the entire half-bottle was poured down his throat.
A scene I’d lived before replayed right in front of me. Wu Wei’s body jerked backward, crashing heavily to the ground. His eyes rolled white, his limbs convulsed violently, and purple-black fluid began to ooze from the corners of his mouth.
I stood frozen, stunned by the sudden turn. Had he died again?
“Hiss-hiss…” A scraping sound came from beneath him. At the same time, I noticed thin strands twitching beside his tattered clothes. I leaned in for a closer look—cockroach antennae. Then the heads emerged. Several palm-sized cockroaches crawled out from under his rags and scuttled toward my feet.
Instinctively, I stepped back and stomped on the nearest one. With a squelch, it was crushed into a puddle of black-and-white mush. At the sound, the others scattered, fleeing up the underpass walls, antennae waving warily as they watched me.
Amid their vigilant stares, I noticed something off. Among the cockroaches was a pair of eyes that radiated pure terror. I shifted my gaze back to Wu Wei. The body that had been sprawled on the ground was now sitting upright. Behind the tangled hair, a pair of black-purple eyes gleamed, accompanied by a grotesque grin.
“You’re not wrong,” the seated Wu Wei spoke, in a raspy voice that was neither male nor female. “The bottle didn’t contain sand. But you had already drunk the last of the water. So how was there any left when you handed it to Wu Wei?”
He meant… he wasn’t Wu Wei?
The “Wu Wei” grinned wider, the corners of his mouth nearly reaching his ears. “Because what was in the bottle wasn’t water. It was me!”
He continued, “I entered Wu Wei’s body and took it over. I should thank you for providing me a host. But I’m not satisfied with this one. By the time I possessed him, he was already on the brink of death. I sustained him for five years. Now he’s burned out, and I’ve had to leave my underground palace to find you. You must secure me a new host.”
As he spoke, he lifted the bottle Wu Wei had held—now containing half a bottle of water. Almost against my will, I took it.
His voice rang out again: “Go. Be my faithful servant. Find the next host and make him drink this half-bottle. You have two days.”
Two days? Was the skin-clad skeleton who told me yesterday I had three days left also working for him? I didn’t buy these ghostly lies. Glancing at the bottle in my hand, I asked coldly, “What if I refuse?”
“Beep-beep-beep…” My phone suddenly rang. It was Manager Sun from Finance. I answered, and her bellow came through: “Do you still want your job? You skipped all of yesterday, and it’s almost 11 a.m. today! Who’s going to do your work?”
“I’m on my way to the office,” I replied quickly. “Got held up. I’ll be there soon.”
I hung up, ignoring the raving beggar, and headed to the company with the half-bottle still in hand.
That androgynous voice called from behind: “You won’t refuse me. You were born to be corporate livestock. You have only the right to obey—no choice.”
