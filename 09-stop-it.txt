9. Stop It
The doctor said I wasn’t sick, but that was a doctor in my dream.
If it wasn’t a dream, then the “crossing” actually happened. How could I prove I’d traveled through time? I carefully recalled everything. If it was a dream, the purple-haired girl from the bathhouse shouldn’t exist. I could go back to the bathhouse to check, but the thought of the bloody words on her forehead made my hair stand on end. I didn’t have the courage to return.
There was one other person who could prove it: Dr. Xu. I’d never met her before. If it was a dream, the real Dr. Xu couldn’t possibly look identical to the one in my dream.
With that thought, I ignored the stunned looks from my colleagues and boss, bolted out of the office, and ran to the psychology clinic in the office building.
“Do you have an appointment?” the receptionist asked, stopping me. I hadn’t seen her before. Was it really a dream?
“No appointment. I need to see Dr. Xu.”
She checked her computer. “Not today. I can book you for tomorrow morning.”
I couldn’t wait until tomorrow. “I just need to confirm something. One look at Dr. Xu will do.” I started walking inside.
The receptionist was diligent, rushing to block me. “I’m sorry, Dr. Xu’s schedule is full. You can’t go in.”
“Let him in. The next patient isn’t here yet.”
That voice sent a shiver through me. It was Dr. Xu. The receptionist stepped aside, and I walked straight into her office.
A bed, two chairs, a desk—exactly like before.
Behind the desk was Dr. Xu, in her white business suit, mask, and black-rimmed glasses, her sharp eyes peering out. It was her. Everything that happened wasn’t a dream.
“Dr. Xu, I’ve crossed over—twice! I saw you before my last crossing. You said I was dreaming. Then I went to a bathhouse and met a purple-haired woman with bloody words on her forehead—my handwriting! No, not mine. I didn’t write on her. I don’t know who did, but it’s identical to mine!”
I spilled my panic incoherently. She didn’t interrupt, listening calmly while setting up the dripping device on her desk.
“Yes, I’ve seen that device before—you used it last time!”
I stopped talking. The water dripped from the bottle onto the hand, then was sucked back through a tube to the bottle—a cycle, just like my life.
She saw I’d stopped, assuming I was done, and said slowly, “So, you don’t like this? What do you want?”
I froze, then anger surged. “Are you treating me like a lunatic? You think this is fine? What do I want? I want the loop to stop!”
Her eyes remained calm. “Oh, then stop it.” She reached out and switched off the device. The water halted in the transparent tube.
I felt like she was treating me like an idiot. “Dr. Xu, are you messing with me? I’m saying I’m stuck in a loop. Every time the phone rings, I’m back at the same moment. I thought you could help, but you’re treating me like a fool.”
Her eyes narrowed slightly. “No misunderstanding. I don’t think you’re a fool. I believe everything you’ve said because I made it happen.”
“How could you make it happen?”
“I just hypnotized you,” she said. “Your bathhouse experience was part of my hypnosis.”
I checked my phone—11:30 AM, October 11. I’d broken the loop. “Hypnosis is that powerful? But I wasn’t asleep. When did it start?”
She pointed to the dripping device. “It started when I turned this on and ended when I turned it off. You couldn’t express yourself clearly when you came in, so I had to use this method to treat you. Please understand.”
I didn’t mind. “You’re the doctor. I’ll accept any treatment. I just want to know if I’m okay.”
“From your hypnosis, I saw two words: choice,” she said, adjusting her glasses. “The bathhouse was your choice, and the purple-haired girl was your creation. She’s both terrifying and tempting—your subconscious. In your real life, something exists that you both cling to and fear. Your subconscious is struggling to make a choice.”
“What’s that ‘something’?” I was confused. I didn’t even know what I was choosing.
“Maybe your job, your family, your entire life. Your subconscious isn’t always easy to accept. Whether you want to figure it out and how to choose—that’s up to you. I can only help you this far.”
The session ended. As I went to the front desk to pay, I heard the door open and close behind me. The next patient had entered Dr. Xu’s office. Soon, I heard their voices—a man, his voice old and raspy, speaking in a thick accent. As I paid and prepared to leave, I caught snippets of muffled, angry words: “…wai…sto…fo’im? …le’im…go?” The voice scraped like sandpaper, eerily familiar.
I didn’t think much of it at the time. But as I left the building, I mulled over the accent. The more I thought, the more it sounded like my grandmother’s drawl from before she passed. A chill ran through me as the garbled words clicked into place: “Why’d you stop it for him? Why’d you let him go?”
I froze, my heart pounding. Behind me, the clinic’s glass windows reflected a blurry shadow, like countless heart-shaped leaves swaying in the wind.
