5. The Ringing
Witnessing someone die before your eyes is an extreme test of psychological endurance. I stared at Wei, someone who was perfectly fine just seconds ago, now transformed into a motionless corpse. This feeling created more panic and despair than the abyss I was in. I felt my entire body go numb as I collapsed to my knees. Then suddenly, with a "wah," I burst into tears. I didn't even know why I was crying. Was it for my deceased companion or for my own hopelessness? It didn't matter anymore. I just needed to release my emotions. No one could see me here, so I could cry unrestrained, hysterically.
I seemed to cry for an eternity, crying until everything blurred, crying until my voice was hoarse and strength depleted, only turning to sobbing when I literally couldn't cry anymore. After a long while, I slowly regained enough strength to climb up from the ground.
People must always accept reality. I wasn't dead, and as long as I lived, I had to act. I glanced at Wei's body, then surveyed the surroundings. Only beneath those plants was there any soil; everywhere else was rock. I would bury him under this patch of what he had called "sweet potato vines."
I found the Swiss Army knife in Wei's pocket, cleared a space among the poisonous plants, and dug a not-very-deep hole. I dragged him into the hole and covered him with soil. This flurry of activity nearly exhausted all my strength. But the work wasn't finished yet. I took out the Swiss Army knife and carved "In Memory of Wei Wu" into the rocky ground in front of the poisonous plants. After carving these few characters, my hand was so weak I couldn't lift it anymore, making it impossible to also carve out his life story.
When everything was done, I looked at Wei's grave and couldn't help but reflect: the roots of the plants would grow dominantly under the soil, and before long, they would pierce through Wei's body, absorbing his nutrients. He had wanted to eat these plants, but in the end, he became their fertilizer, consumed by them instead.
"Ah!" A heavy sigh suddenly sounded. It was like what we had heard earlier from above, only louder now and closer to me.
Following the sound of the sigh, I returned to the protruding rock and searched around with my flashlight. Not far from the rock beneath my feet, I saw a black hole about 2 meters wide. I hadn't noticed it during my first inspection of the surroundings. Had I missed it, or had it just appeared?
I jumped down from the protruding rock and walked over. The entrance was slanted, with a row of pointed stalactites above and below. Water occasionally dripped from the tips of the stalactites. Holding onto one stalactite, I shined my flashlight into the hole: inside the black hole seemed to be another black hole, bottomless, and on either side of the inner hole were two stone slabs. And the slabs were moving!
"Ah!" Another enormous sigh rang out, accompanied by a strong cold wind blowing from the entrance. Simultaneously, I saw the two stone slabs inside the hole vibrate rapidly several times.
Then I understood the principle behind the sighing sound: wind blew out from the hole, moving the two stone slabs and causing them to vibrate and make sounds. Wait, isn't this the same principle as human vocalization?
If the two stone slabs in the black hole were vocal cords, then this black hole was a giant mouth. The rows of stalactites at the entrance were teeth. The protruding rock where I stood earlier was a nose, the two pools were eyes, and the purplish-black plants were hair. This bizarre place I was in was actually a human face!
The frequency of water dripping from the stalactite tips increased. I instinctively backed away, wanting to distance myself from this mouth salivating for food.
The wind rose again, stronger than before. This time, the wind wasn't blowing outward from the hole but inward from outside. At the same time, the "vocal cords" began to vibrate with the wind, and this time the sound wasn't a sigh but a sharp ringing.
The wind grew stronger. I began to lose my footing, sucked into that "mouth" by the powerful airflow. I quickly braced my body against one of the "teeth" at the edge of the "mouth." But the "mouth" didn't give up, sucking with even more force. Meanwhile, the ringing from the "vocal cords" became even more piercingly shrill.
"Ring-ring-ring!"
I woke up, not in my own bed at home, but at my desk in the office. The telephone on my desk was ringing incessantly. So everything in the cave had indeed been a dream.
I quickly answered the phone.
There was silence on the other end. After a few seconds, a voice, extremely hoarse and indistinguishable as either male or female, suddenly spoke:
"That box, don't open it!"
My heart skipped a beat, and I hastily hung up.
Why did I receive this phone call again? Why was I in the office? I didn't remember coming to work today.
Just as I was puzzled, a message suddenly popped up in the work group chat:
Financial Department Manager Sun: Meeting today at 4:45 regarding recent work arrangements (2022-10-10)
It's now the afternoon of October 10th.
