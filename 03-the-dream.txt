3. The Dream
Our family of three lived in a high-rise apartment where the property management conducted pest control every six months. Usually, we couldn't even find an ant in our home, so I had no idea why such a large cockroach appeared today.
Ruoli was badly frightened, she had never seen such a huge cockroach before. When we went to bed that night, she hugged me tightly and said, "I'm scared. Don't leave tonight."
I pretended to be asleep and didn't answer her.
Seeing that I wasn't responding, she held me even tighter and wrapped her legs around me, afraid I might run away.
A wave of drowsiness came over me. In this tight embrace, my consciousness began to blur, and I felt my body gradually sinking. The legs wrapped around me changed from smooth to rough, and eventually grew bristles that scratched against my body, causing dull pain. When I opened my eyes again, what was holding me wasn't my wife Ruoli, but a giant cockroach about three feet long. Its bristly legs pressed down on me, and its two antennae swept back and forth across my face.
I was already terrified by what I saw, forgetting to resist or even to scream. I just lay flat on the ground waiting to die. My reaction seemed to meet the cockroach's expectations. After its antennae swept over me for a while, it opened its mouth, two sharp teeth spreading left and right, and aimed at my neck, biting down.
I thought I was finished, but after waiting for a while, those sharp teeth still hovered above, not biting down. I saw a hand pulling back on the two antennae on the cockroach's head, followed by a red-handled Swiss Army knife slicing through the cockroach's neck.
When I came to my senses, Wei was standing in front of me, holding the Swiss Army knife in one hand and the cockroach's head in the other. The headless cockroach lay beside me, not quite dead, its six legs still clawing at the air.
"You're really something, a cockroach crawls onto you, and you're still sleeping like a baby," Wei said to me, breathing heavily.
It took me a while before I could speak: "Such a huge cockroach, aren't you afraid?"
Wei tossed aside the cockroach head he was holding: "What's there to be afraid of? No matter how big it is, it's still just an insect. I'm a primate mammal, many evolutionary levels above it."
He was right, but in wilderness survival, evolutionary level isn't what matters. Of course, I didn't argue with him. Instead, I got up from the ground to examine our surroundings.
The flashlight was lying beside me, the only light source in this cave. It pointed toward the entrance through which we had come, now completely filled with sand. Buried there was our car, our food and water, and that strange box.
I picked up the flashlight and surveyed our environment: beneath our feet was a thin layer of sand covering solid rock. About 100 meters ahead was the end of the rock, below which was a bottomless abyss. Behind us was a hard rock wall with the sand-buried entrance at its base. On the wall clung many cockroaches of various sizes, the smallest the size of a palm, the largest about three feet long. They all waved their antennae, vigilantly monitoring us. When we moved around, they didn't dare do anything to us, but once we fell asleep, it was another story.
Thinking about the cockroach that had just been lying on top of me, baring its fangs, I involuntarily shuddered again. The circle of light from the flashlight trembled with me.
Wei seemed to know what I was thinking: "Actually, these cockroaches aren't that scary. In this bottom-dwelling world, although they're large and numerous, they're still cowardly by nature! If they had all come down together, we would have been eaten long ago, but they don't dare. They just harbor evil intentions, waiting to play dirty tricks. That's why they're only fit to eke out a living in this sunless place."
Wei described the pathetic nature of cockroaches in this underworld. In the real world, aren't people just the same? I suddenly thought of my real self: forced to work overtime by the manager, yet only daring to curse behind his back while acting subservient to his face. If all employees just got up and left at quitting time, the manager wouldn't dare do anything to us. Unfortunately, not one employee had the guts, those with courage had already quit and gone off to exploit others themselves.
Thinking about my real self, I realized I was in a dream. Might as well move the plot along, if I dawdle any longer, it'll be dawn and I won't have anything to write.
"Let's keep moving forward," I called to Wei.
Wei was kneeling by the entrance, both hands continuously digging at the sand inside. Hearing my words, he paused: "Forward?"
"Yes. The path must be ahead."
I started walking forward, approaching the abyss. Wei followed. Finally, we both stood at the edge of the cliff, staring into the bottomless void.
"Where's the path?" Wei asked, looking confused.
"Jump down. The path is below."
Wei's expression grew even more perplexed: "The path to the afterlife?"
I didn't want to waste time talking with him: "Don't ask. The plot requires it. Let's jump first and talk later."
Wei grabbed me firmly: "What plot are you talking about, brother? Did that cockroach scare you out of your mind? Stop this nonsense and come help me dig out the sand at the entrance!"
I finally couldn't hold back and confessed to him: "Everything is a dream! Here, don't judge based on common sense. We only need to consider how to advance the plot! How could the plot have us return the way we came?"
I didn't know why I was explaining this to a person in my dream, I'd have to cut this part out when I wrote it down later. Wei didn't speak, just listened quietly.
So I continued, "In reality, deserts don’t have cockroaches. In reality, cockroaches aren’t this big. In reality, I have a wife and kid—I’d never come to a place like this on some treasure hunt. So this desert, this cave, these cockroaches, and even you, Wu Wei. you’re all just part of the dream. I created you."
Wei still didn't speak, looking at me with an expression one might use when caring for a mentally challenged child. After thirty seconds, making sure I had finished, he finally spoke: "Oh, wow！what a genius! even I was created by you."
As he spoke, he pulled out the Swiss Army knife from his pocket and suddenly slashed my arm. The sudden pain made me instinctively jerk my hand away, using my other hand to cover the wound.
Wei continued: "Does it hurt? Still think you're dreaming? Wake up! You don't have a wife or child,you're just a single as fuck! This is reality!"
