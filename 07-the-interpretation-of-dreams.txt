7. The Interpretation of Dreams
I had insomnia, lying awake watching the sky change from black to gray to blue. Ever since I heard Ruoli say in her sleep, "Give me some water to drink," I couldn't fall asleep again.
In the morning, Ruoli got up, and Xiaobao got up too. I also washed up and went out as usual. But I didn't go to the company; I took a sick day. Perhaps after going through life and death in my dream, I've become braver in reality than before—not only daring to leave work on time but also daring to take sick leave. If you find what I'm saying amusing, congratulations—you probably haven't worked in a company with so-called "wolf culture."
I didn't take sick leave to sleep at home; I genuinely felt that something was wrong with me. A series of incredible things had happened to me, and I needed someone to give me a reasonable explanation. I made an appointment with a psychologist recommended by a friend. The doctor's surname was Xu, and fortunately, she had time this morning.
The clinic was in a low-rise office building. The exterior looked somewhat old, but the interior was surprisingly modern. I took the elevator up, and at the elevator door hung a sign that read "Kangping Psychological Clinic" in large characters. To the left of the characters, several curved lines formed a heart-shaped logo. Now whenever I see heart-shaped things, I instinctively associate them with the heart-shaped leaves in my dream.
Arriving at the clinic's front desk, a receptionist in a white uniform handed me a form that detailed personal information and medical history. As I bent down to fill out the form carefully, I noticed from the corner of my eye that the heart-shaped logo was also printed in the upper right corner of the form. The ceiling fan blew at my form, and as the corner of the paper fluttered constantly, that curved heart seemed to wiggle along with it, making my skin crawl. I felt I was already too sensitive and nervous—indeed, it was time to see a psychologist.
I didn't wait long before the girl at the front desk called my name and led me into a room inside. The room had a bed, two chairs, and a desk. Behind the desk sat a woman. She looked to be in her early thirties, with long hair, dressed in white professional attire, wearing black-framed glasses and a mask. Although the mask covered most of her face, I could see her sharpness and wisdom in her eyes.
"Hello, I'm Mo Xu. Tell me why you’re here." she said in a clear, steady voice that carried a sense of security. It was as if I had grabbed onto a lifesaving straw. With a pile of things clogged in my heart, I finally had someone to confide in. I had just sat down and couldn't wait to tell her: "Dr. Xu, I've recently experienced some very abnormal things. I don't know what's going on. Is there something wrong with my mental state?" At this point, I couldn't continue because I felt my mouth trembling so much that I couldn't speak. I am a writer; narrating something should be the simplest thing for me, but at this moment, I couldn't utter a single word.
Dr. Xu extended her palm, signaling me to pause, then took out a device from under the desk and placed it on the table. I had never seen this device before. It was divided into upper and lower parts: above was an inverted bottle filled with water, and below was a human hand, connected by a thin, curved tube in the middle. Dr. Xu turned on the switch, and water from the bottle began to drip from the narrow opening into the "palm" below. The back of the hand had a tube that pumped the water that dripped into the palm back up to the bottle above.
She also adjusted the drip rate with a knob next to the switch, making the water drops produce a "tick-tock" sound at a soothing rhythm. After doing all this, Dr. Xu looked up at me:
"Take your time. Don't be nervous. Usually, those who can come to see me on their own don't have major problems."
Her voice was very clear, and accompanied by the sound of water drops, I felt as relaxed as if I had melted into nature. Her method seemed very effective. Following the sound of dripping water, I adjusted my mindset and began to tell her about my strange experiences these past few days.
Dr. Xu listened to my narrative with her hands on the keyboard in front of her chest, but she rarely typed. Her eyes were constantly on me, without any expression. Only when I mentioned that the beggar in the underground passage looked like Wu Wei did she frown, but she didn't interrupt me. Only after I had finished everything did she say in her soothing tone: "Let me help you clarify what happened. From your recounted experiences, I can summarize three possibilities.
The first possibility: On the afternoon of October 10th, you fell asleep at your desk at work and dreamed of staying late for meetings, dreamed of going home, and while sleeping at home, had another dream about a fantasy story in a cave.
The second possibility: On October 10th, you went home after work, had a dream at night about that cave, also dreamed that you traveled back to that afternoon, and then dreamed that you didn't sleep all night and came here for psychological counseling.
The third possibility: The real you is currently in the cave, and your urban life these past two days has all been in a dream.
So, can you be sure you're not dreaming right now?"
I looked around. On the not-so-smooth walls hung several certificates of honor for Dr. Xu. Outside the window, withered branches on the big tree swayed in disarray, and beneath the tree were a few broken fallen leaves and colorful plastic wrappers. I looked back at Dr. Xu in front of me: eyeshadow, foundation, brushed eyelashes. Every detail was impeccable.
"I'm certain. I'm not dreaming."
Dr. Xu nodded approvingly: "Very good. You don't have any serious problems. Just make sure to rest well. I'll prescribe some sleep-aid medication for you."
Hearing the doctor's words, I also let out a long sigh of relief.
Dr. Xu continued: "Next, let's talk more about the content of your dream. You said you saw your dream companion called Wu Wei in the underground passage, and this Wu Wei was created by you in the dream and doesn't exist in reality. Can you try to draw this Wu Wei?"
As she spoke, she took out a sheet of A4 paper and a pencil from the drawer and handed them to me.
I took the paper and pencil, recalling Wu Wei's appearance in the dream, and began to draw on the paper. Soon, Wu Wei's face appeared on the A4 paper. I was very satisfied with my work; every detail was perfectly restored, so realistic it looked like a black and white photograph.
I lifted the paper with both hands to show Dr. Xu, suddenly felt uncomfortable, and put the paper back on the table. Because the moment I held up this "black and white photo," my mind suddenly flashed to the scene of my grandfather's funeral procession when he passed away, where my posture holding the memorial portrait was exactly the same as now.
Dr. Xu picked up the A4 paper from the table. I saw her eyebrows raise slightly as she looked at my drawing: "Are you in an artistic profession?"
"No, I work in the finance department."
Dr. Xu nodded: "You're really multi-talented."
Her praise made me feel good, but before I could feel happy, she continued: "Characters in dreams usually don't have specific appearances. The fact that you can accurately draw him indicates that this person must exist in your reality."
Exists in reality? I began to search through my memory. Apart from that beggar on the overpass, there was no one who looked like Wu Wei. I thought for a long time but ultimately came up empty. Who was he?
Dr. Xu seemed to see through my confusion and put down the paper, saying calmly: "Actually, you don't need to obsess over who he is. He might be someone you met in your childhood who wasn't important to you. As long as this doesn't continue to affect your life, you can ignore it. Just do things that make you happy right now. Relax your mind, take your medication on time, and you'll return to normal soon."
Today's psychological consultation seemed to be ending. As I was about to leave, I suddenly thought of another question:
"Dr. Xu, how can I determine whether I'm dreaming or not?"
"You don't need to determine that. If it's a dream, it will eventually end. When you wake up, you'll naturally know.
